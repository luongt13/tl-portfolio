            <p>While working as a Dietitian, I was intrigued by the software and tools I used. I wished there were certain tools out there to better help my patients.</p>
            <p>At the end of 2019, I decided along with a couple others to build a website with simple and easy to understand health information. My hope was to better equip health care professionals to education patients.</p>
